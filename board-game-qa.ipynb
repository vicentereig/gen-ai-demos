Players should prioritize access to wood, brick, wheat, and sheep for early expansion. The strategy should adapt to the number of players, with more selectivity in a 3-player game and a balanced approach in a 4-player game. Avoiding common mistakes, such as neglecting resource balance and future growth, is crucial. Strategic placement should also consider long-term trading potential and expansion opportunities.'\n",
