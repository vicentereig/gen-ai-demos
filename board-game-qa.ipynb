Each hex on the board is assigned a number between 2 and 12, and these numbers correspond to the roll of two six-sided dice. Numbers like 6 and 8 are more likely to be rolled than numbers like 2 and 12, making them more valuable. The best opening move involves placing settlements on intersections that maximize access to high-frequency numbers, ensuring a steady flow of resources.

      "In Catan, the initial placement of settlements is crucial because it sets the foundation for resource acquisition and trading opportunities throughout the game. Settlements placed at the intersection of hexes with high probability numbers (such as 6s and 8s) increase the likelihood of resource production. Additionally, having access to a variety of resources (brick, wood, sheep, wheat, and ore) is important for building roads, settlements, and cities. If a player can secure settlements on diverse resources, they are less reliant on trading with others. However, if a player lacks certain resources, they must rely on trading, making it essential to be near ports or have settlements that can produce surplus resources for trade. Strategic placement can also block opponents from accessing key resources or expansion paths, further enhancing trading leverage.\n",
