    "This implementation showcases how you could build AGoT using DSPy's composable abstractions. Let me explain the key components:\n",
    "Core Components of the Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. DSPy Signatures and Modules for each AGoT Operation,\n",
    "\n",
    "- `T0`: Generates initial thoughts (first layer)\n",
    "- `Te`: Expands the graph with additional thoughts and edges\n",
    "- `C`: Checks thought complexity to determine if recursion is needed\n",
    "- `Eval`: Evaluates non-complex thoughts\n",
    "- `Phi`: Synthesizes the final answer from the complete graph\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Graph Structure: I use NetworkX to represent the directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure, with each node containing a Thought object that tracks important metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Recursive Implementation: The _recursive_agot method implements the core algorithm described in the paper, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Layer-by-layer generation of thoughts\n",
    "- Complexity checking\n",
    "- Recursive processing for complex thoughts\n",
    "- Final answer synthesis\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Visualization: The implementation includes a `visualize_graph` method to help understand the resulting reasoning structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How This Maps to the Paper\n",
    "The implementation closely follows the mathematical formalism in Section 2 of the paper:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The heritage tracking system `(h = (s₀, s₁, ..., sₙ)) `is implemented using a list of layer and node index tuples\n",
    "- The complexity function `C: T × G → {0, 1}` maps directly to the ComplexityChecker module\n",
    "- The evaluation function `Eval: T × G → A` corresponds to the ThoughtEvaluator module\n",
    "- The final synthesis function `Φ: G → T` is implemented as the FinalAnswerSynthesizer module\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "DSPy makes it easy to swap different language models as backends, which would be useful for testing different LLMs with AGoT.\n",
    "The implementation focuses on the core AGoT algorithm rather than specific optimization techniques mentioned in the paper.\n",
    "In a full implementation, you might want to add:\n",
    "\n",
    "Better prompt engineering for each module\n",
    "More sophisticated termination conditions\n",
    "Parallelization for asynchronous thought evaluation\n",
    "Metrics collection and evaluation against benchmarks"

This strategy can be illustrated through three potential scenarios:\\n\\n1. **Scenario 1: Balanced Resource Access**  \\n   By placing a settlement on a location that provides access to wheat, wood, and brick, a player can ensure a steady supply of essential resources for building roads and settlements. This balanced access allows for quick expansion, enabling the player to secure additional settlements and potentially block opponents from key areas. The early game advantage of having multiple settlements can lead to a strong mid-game position.\\n\\n2. **Scenario 2: Port Access**  \\n   Establishing a settlement near a port, particularly a 2:1 port for a resource that the player has in abundance, can be a game-changer. For instance, if a player has access to a lot of wood and places a settlement next to a wood port, they can trade wood for other resources more efficiently. This strategy can lead to a resource surplus, allowing the player to build more settlements and roads than opponents, ultimately leading to victory points.\\n\\n3. **Scenario 3: High-Yield Resource Focus**  \\n   Prioritizing a settlement on high-yield resource tiles, such as a wheat tile with a high number (like 6 or 8), can significantly enhance a player's resource generation. This move can lead to rapid development, as wheat is crucial for building settlements and cities. If the player can secure this position early, they can outpace opponents in development cards and cities, which are vital for scoring points and gaining advantages in the game.\\n\\nIn summary, the best opening move in Catan often involves strategic placement that maximizes resource access and potential for expansion, setting the stage for a strong game performance.\",\n",
