    "This implementation showcases how you could build AGoT using DSPy's composable abstractions. Let me explain the key components:\n",
    "Core Components of the Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. DSPy Signatures and Modules for each AGoT Operation,\n",
    "\n",
    "- `T0`: Generates initial thoughts (first layer)\n",
    "- `Te`: Expands the graph with additional thoughts and edges\n",
    "- `C`: Checks thought complexity to determine if recursion is needed\n",
    "- `Eval`: Evaluates non-complex thoughts\n",
    "- `Phi`: Synthesizes the final answer from the complete graph\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Graph Structure: I use NetworkX to represent the directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure, with each node containing a Thought object that tracks important metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Recursive Implementation: The _recursive_agot method implements the core algorithm described in the paper, including:\n",

    "- Complexity checking\n",
    "- Recursive processing for complex thoughts\n",
    "- Final answer synthesis\n",

    "5. Visualization: The implementation includes a `visualize_graph` method to help understand the resulting reasoning structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How This Maps to the Paper\n",
    "The implementation closely follows the mathematical formalism in Section 2 of the paper:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The heritage tracking system `(h = (s₀, s₁, ..., sₙ)) `is implemented using a list of layer and node index tuples\n",
    "- The complexity function `C: T × G → {0, 1}` maps directly to the ComplexityChecker module\n",
    "- The evaluation function `Eval: T × G → A` corresponds to the ThoughtEvaluator module\n",
    "- The final synthesis function `Φ: G → T` is implemented as the FinalAnswerSynthesizer module\n",

      "Final Answer: One of the best opening moves in Catan is to place a settlement at the intersection of a wheat, ore, and brick resource. This combination allows for a strong start, as wheat is essential for building settlements and cities, ore is crucial for upgrading settlements to cities, and brick is necessary for road building. Here are three potential scenarios showcasing the best performance of this opening move:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Scenario 1: Early Expansion**  \n",
      "   By placing the initial settlement on a wheat, ore, and brick intersection, a player can quickly build roads to expand towards additional resource tiles. If the player can connect to a wood resource tile, they can then build more settlements, increasing their resource production significantly. This early expansion can lead to a dominant position in the game, allowing the player to control key areas and resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Scenario 2: City Development**  \n",
      "   With access to wheat and ore, the player can prioritize upgrading their settlements to cities. This move not only increases their resource production but also positions them to gain the Largest Army or Longest Road bonuses. If the player can secure a city on a high-yield resource tile, they can effectively outpace their opponents in resource generation, leading to a quicker path to victory points.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Scenario 3: Trade Leverage**  \n",
      "   By starting with a strong resource combination, the player can leverage their wheat and ore to trade with other players who may be lacking these resources. This trade can help the player acquire wood and sheep, allowing them to build more settlements and roads. The ability to trade effectively can create a snowball effect, where the player continues to grow their resource base while limiting the growth of their opponents.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, placing a settlement at the intersection of wheat, ore, and brick not only provides a balanced resource foundation but also opens up multiple strategic avenues for expansion, development, and trade, making it one of the best opening moves in Catan.\n",

Actions: Collaborate with healthcare organizations to understand their hiring needs, share case studies, and engage with healthcare communities online.\n\n3. **Remote Work**: Focus on matching candidates with remote job opportunities across various industries. Actions: Host webinars on remote work best practices, create content around remote job searching, and build a community for remote workers.\n\n4. **Diversity Hiring**: Build a platform that emphasizes diversity and inclusion in hiring practices. Actions: Partner with organizations focused on diversity, share success stories, and create resources for companies looking to improve their diversity hiring.\n\n5. **Freelance and Gig Economy**: Cater to freelancers and gig workers by connecting them with short-term projects. Actions: Engage with freelance communities, share tips for freelancers, and gather feedback on what features they would find valuable in a recruiting assistant.\n\nTo build an audience and test your hypothesis, consistently share your progress on social media, engage with potential users through surveys and polls, and create valuable content that addresses their pain points.

      "text/markdown": "**The Best Opening Move in Catan: A Strategic Overview**\n\nIn the game of Catan, the opening move is crucial as it sets the tone for the entire game. Choosing the right combination of resources can lead to a significant advantage. Here, we explore three potential scenarios that showcase the best performance based on different resource strategies.\n\n### Scenario 1: The Wheat and Wood Strategy\n**Maximizing Development Cards and Roads**\n\nThe Wheat and Wood Strategy is a powerful opening move that focuses on securing access to wheat and wood early in the game. By placing settlements on hexes that yield these resources, players can quickly build roads and settlements, allowing them to expand their territory. \n\nIn this scenario, a player places their first settlement on a wheat hex (preferably a 6 or 8 for higher probability) and a wood hex. This combination not only provides the essential resources for building but also positions the player to compete for the longest road. As the game progresses, the ability to purchase development cards becomes crucial, as they can lead to victory points and additional resources. This strategy excels in games where expansion is key, and players can leverage their early lead to control critical areas of the board.\n\n### Scenario 2: The Brick and Ore Power Play\n**Building Cities and Dominating Resource Control**\n\nFocusing on brick and ore production is a strategic move that can lead to a powerful mid-game. By placing settlements on high-yield brick and ore hexes, players can quickly build cities, which significantly increase their resource output. \n\nIn this scenario, a player might place their first settlement on a brick hex (ideally a 5 or 9) and an ore hex. This combination allows for rapid city development, which can outpace opponents who are still building settlements. The key to this strategy is to maintain control over brick production, as it is essential for building roads and settlements. As cities are built, the player can also start purchasing development cards, which can provide additional victory points and resources. This strategy shines in games where resource scarcity is a factor, allowing the player to dominate the board with fewer but more powerful settlements.\n\n### Scenario 3: The Balanced Resource Approach\n**Flexibility and Adaptability in Resource Management**\n\nA balanced resource strategy in the game allows players to adapt to changing circumstances and opponents' moves. By securing access to a variety of resources, players can pivot their strategy based on the flow of the game.\n\nIn this scenario, a player places their first settlement on a combination of wheat, brick, and ore hexes. This diverse resource base enables the player to build settlements, cities, and roads while also allowing for the purchase of development cards. The flexibility of this approach means that if one resource becomes scarce, the player can still rely on others to maintain their momentum. This strategy is particularly effective in games with multiple players, where resource competition can lead to unexpected shortages. By being adaptable, players can seize opportunities as they arise, making this a well-rounded opening move.\n\nIn conclusion, the best opening move in Catan can vary based on the player's strategy and the dynamics of the game. Whether focusing on wheat and wood, brick and ore, or a balanced approach, each scenario offers unique advantages that can lead to victory."
